# CS340

In creating this project I began with creating a CRUD module in python. 
This had the advantage of creating code which was maintainable and extensible throughout the project.
I found that later on, I was able abstract the CRUD methods, and not think about how they worked when calling them. 
Moreover, in developing specific Read methods, I was able to revisit the CRUD modules to utilize the same code logic
for the more advanced searces.
